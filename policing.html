                This is a study containing roughly 100 police officers and 100 students who are assessed on their beliefs about deceptive cues and how accurate their beliefs are compared to scientific research on the topic.  The study focuses on non-verbal and verbal cues, explaining how verbal cues can be more accurate in detecting deception.  Both students and officers had beliefs that were incorrect, with students being more likely to claim that they knew or didn’t know whether something was a deceptive cue, while officers were more likely to state that they did not know if something was a sign of deception.  There is also information about different methodologies of detecting deception, with one highlight being the SCAN method.  This is a method that the writers argue is popular due to the vague interpretations that can fit the user’s biases, while not having any true scientific backing for being effective.

                This is a meta-analysis looking at 30 different studies and their findings on how effective training for truth and deception detection is.  This is quite a lengthy paper, but some interesting findings from the analysis include the difference in effect for training for deception compared to truth.  Because humans have an inherent bias towards truth, the authors argue that the findings show that truth detection training methods are much less effective than deception training methods.  Like other studies referenced in this paper, verbal cues are seen to be more effective, but are underutilized in real practice.  The authors make recommendations for real-world usage of deception training, including a focus on verbal cues, discussion of practitioners’ biases, and having training not be exclusively in video format.
