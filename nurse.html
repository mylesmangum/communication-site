Nursing Students’ Beliefs and Attitudes
                
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is a study analyzing both nursing students' understanding of deception cues, as well as nursing students’ opinions on deceptive patients.  A sample of about 60 nursing students was taken from a university and given questionnaires on what they believed to be deceptive cues, and their attitudes towards those patients.  The students only held accurate beliefs about the given deceptive cues for 6 out of the 28 possible indicators, while also holding negative attitudes toward a patient that they had found lied to them.  The paper discusses the possibilities of why beliefs about deceptive cues could be incorrect, as well as ideas on how to solve the issues discovered in the paper.  Implementing training or classes that focus on both identifying actual deception cues, as well as understanding the impact on the patient when beliefs about lies are held by nursing staff.  The paper states that the level of impact negative beliefs about patients have on the quality of care is not clear from this study, but more research should be conducted in the future on this topic.
