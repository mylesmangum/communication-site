            </h1>

                Nonverbal communication analysis is a popular area of study and an important tool for different organizations to go about understanding the veracity of individuals’ statements.  While there is scientific backing for some claims, the utilization of pseudoscience by people such as judges or other legal professionals can have serious impacts on people’s lives.  Common misconceptions about nonverbal cues for deception include things like fidgeting and coughing, which may say more about the stress level of a person, rather than whether what they are saying is true or untrue.  While there is much research and understanding of the techniques of deception detection for police officers, individuals such as judges have not been studied to the extent needed.  There is worrying information about a method called “synerology,” which is being taught in Quebec as a good tool for understanding nonverbal deception cues, which the author argues is untrue.  The author pushes for interpersonal communication classes or other psychology courses to be provided during legal training, to prevent pseudoscience such as this from being so easily digested.  Changes in the system cannot happen overnight, but with the inclusion of groups such as judges in scientific studies, perhaps there can be an improvement in scientific understanding in the justice system.
