            <p>In movies and TV, we have learned how to detect peopleâ€™s lies.  We look for nervous movements, lack of eye contact, and all kinds of signs of anxiety.  These traits are easily identifiable and allow us to quickly make judgments to understand a situation better.  In the real world, similar tactics are used and trained into police, TSA, and other authority figures.  But what if the traits we are looking for are the wrong ones?  What if these identifiers only make sense because we think people who lie, or have something to hide, will always be nervous?  </p>
            <p>In places where safety and truth are necessary, decisions are being made based on bad information.  Large sums of money are being invested in methods with no scientific backing or evidence of efficacy, and this causes real harm to real people.</p>
            <p>Within this site, I am trying to challenge some of these misconceptions and provide examples of where change would make the most impact.  I want to provide the information and tools necessary for people to make an impact in their communities.  Down below are different articles and resources for you to understand this topic better, and what we can do to not feel helpless in this situation.</p>

                    <p>Understanding what is true and what is a myth, in relation to deceptive cues, is a great start.  We can't advocate for what we don't know</p>
                    <p>Where the biggest impact can be, is within policing policies.  </p>
