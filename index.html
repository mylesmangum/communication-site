            <p>In movies and TV, we have learned how to detect people’s lies.  We look for nervous movements, lack of eye contact, and all kinds of signs of anxiety.  These traits are easily identifiable and allow us to quickly make judgments to understand a situation better.  In the real world, similar tactics are used and trained into police, TSA, and other authority figures.  But what if the traits we are looking for are the wrong ones?  What if these identifiers only make sense because we think people who lie, or have something to hide, will always be nervous?  </p>
            <p>In places where safety and truth are necessary, decisions are being made based on bad information.  Large sums of money are being invested in methods with no scientific backing or evidence of efficacy, and this causes real harm to real people.</p>
            <p>Within this site, I am trying to challenge some of these misconceptions and provide examples of where change would make the most impact.  I want to provide the information and tools necessary for people to make an impact in their communities.  Down below are different articles and resources for you to understand this topic better, and what we can do to not feel helpless in this situation.</p>

                        <h2>Real World Impact</h2>
                        <p>Incorrect and pseudoscientific methodologies to identify threats and deception are utilized around the world.  Organizations like the TSA utilize tools such as SPOT, or as it is now known known Behavior Detection and Analysis (BDA), which holds the same core principles. Billions of dollars are invested in these strategies that have never been shown to be any more effective than not utilizing them.</p>
                        <p>Across the globe, different authority figures have also been influenced by a methodology called “synergology”, which is a discipline where practitioners are able to interpret non-verbal communication to identify hidden messages, such as lies.  The claims made by practitioners do not have any substantial evidence behind their practices, and where a vacuum of evidence-based methods exists, ideas such as synergology fill the void.</p>
                        <p>Along with these issues, research shows that in certain environments like healthcare, if providers believe that the person they are treating is lying to them, they will receive worse care.  This is even more concerning because while we may believe we can tell when someone is lying, in research, lie prediction is as reliable as predicting a coin toss.  A built-in bias alongside a, perhaps, misplaced confidence is a recipe for disaster.</p>

                    <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
                    <p>Understanding what is true and what is a myth, in relation to deceptive cues, is a great start.  We can't advocate for what we don't know</p>
                    <p>If you would like to help more, there are several different steps you can take to try to make a difference.  First, there are no national standards for police departments, so to understand if your local community utilizes unscientific procedures you need to find that information on your police department's site or manual.  After finding that information, asking local representatives in your area about these issues, or informing them about why this is problematic can be a great start for change.  </p>
                    <p>Asking your local and national representatives to advocate for more investment into interpersonal communication, specifically in identifying lies and reputability, for judges and juries could help reduce unnecessary biases within courtrooms.</p>
