                This is a study containing roughly 100 police officers and 100 students who are assessed on their beliefs about deceptive cues and how accurate their beliefs are compared to scientific research on the topic.  The study focuses on non-verbal and verbal cues, explaining how verbal cues can be more accurate in detecting deception.  Both students and officers had beliefs that were incorrect, with students being more likely to claim that they knew or didn’t know whether something was a deceptive cue, while officers were more likely to state that they did not know if something was a sign of deception.  There is also information about different methodologies of detecting deception, with one highlight being the SCAN method.  This is a method that the writers argue is popular due to the vague interpretations that can fit the user’s biases, while not having any true scientific backing for being effective.

                The incorrect cues that the officers believed included criteria that is included within the SCAN (Scientific Content Analysis) method, a method used by many police departments.  It's important to state that the SCAN method has no scientific backing, and the cues that line up with this method have no evidence to support their use.
